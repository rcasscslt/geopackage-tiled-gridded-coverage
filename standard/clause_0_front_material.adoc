[big]*i.     Abstract*

The "GeoPackage Extension for Tiled Gridded Coverage Data” extension (previously titled Elevation Extension) defines how to encode and store tiled regular gridded data, such as a digital elevation model, in a GeoPackage. In the ISO 19123 Schema for Coverage Geometry standard and in the OGC Coverage Implementation Schema, this type of regular gridded data is classed as `grid-regular` footnote:[Grid-regular in OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS). More specifically, for a continuous grid-regular coverage, see CV_ContinuousQuadrilateralGridCoverage in ISO 19123 and OGC Topic Volume 6.]. The tiles contain values, such as elevation, temperature or pressure, and may be stored as 16-bit PNG files or 32-bit TIFF files. The extension defines two ancillary data tables: one for regular gridded coverages and one for tiles. When using the PNG encoding, a scale and offset may be applied. The extension also allows for a TIFF encoding but constrains many of the TIFF options that are available to simplify development.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

"GeoPackage Extension for Tiled Gridded Coverage Data” was initially documented in the GeoPackage 1.2 draft standard as Annex F.11 Tiled Gridded Elevation Data. In 2016, the GeoPackage Elevation Extension was tested and refined as part of the OGC GeoPackage Elevation Extension Interoperability Experiment footnote:[https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=70051&version=1]. Based on the results of the Interoperability Experiment, the candidate extension was edited and submitted to the OGC Architecture Board for review and consideration. The OGC Architecture Board recommended that the Elevation extension not be an Annex of the core GeoPackage standard but instead should be a separate document. This document is the result of implementing that recommendation. As part of the work, the scope of the extension was expanded from just elevation data to any regular gridded coverage data.

NOTE and WARNING: Any implementations of the candidate standard prior to August 2017 may need to be revised to comply with changes to Table 1: Coverage Ancillary Table Definitions. Specifically, “pixel_encoding” has been changed to “grid_cell_encoding” and additional columns have been added to the Table.

The following information is provided in compliance with the GeoPackage Extension template as defined in Annex E: GeoPackage Extension Template of the GeoPackage Standard. These additional introductory clauses are not elements in the standard OGC document template.

* Extension Author: GeoPackage SWG, author_name `gpkg`.
* Extension Name or Template: `gpkg_elevation_tiles`.
* Extension Type: This extension has a dependency on http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tiles[_Clause 2.2_]footnote:[The GeoPackage (Clause 2.2) Tiles option specifies a mechanism for storing raster data in tile pyramids in a GeoPackage data store.] of the core GeoPackage standard.
* Applicability: This GeoPackage Gridded Coverages extension can be used to store any gridded coverage in a GeoPackage data store. This extension specifies requirements and optional clauses for additional GeoPackage tables as well as requirements for extensions to http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#tiles_user_tables[_tile pyramid user data tables_] (Clause 2.2.8 of the GeoPackage core) that can be used to hold tiled, gridded coverage data.
* Scope: read-write
